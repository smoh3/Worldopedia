          <p class="culture-text">Indian culture consists of the languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food, and customs that differ from place to place within the country. Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism are all Indian-origin religions. Many festivals, such as Diwali (the festival or lights) and Holi (festival of colors) come from Hinduism, the most prominent religion. India is also the birthplace of many ancient art forms. Bharatanatyam is one very popular traditional Indian dance style, but there are many others as well.Carnatic singing is prominent in the music realm. Indian cuisine is world-renowned for being spicy, but it actually encompasses dishes from salads to sauces, vegetarian to meat, and savory to sweet. Some traditional Indian garments include sarees for women and a kurthas for men.

            <p class="issues-text">One major problem in India is the persisting consideration of the caste system, and it is the root cause of many other issues. It is an outdated social hierarchy that ranks individuals by the caste which they were born into, with little opportunity for mobility. Though it has been constitutionally outlawed to discriminate by caste, it remains a significant factor in deciding everything from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities, especially in small towns and villages, where the majority of Indians live. In more recent news, a new wave of Islamophobia has come about after the Indian authorities announced that they found a large number of coronavirus positive cases among Muslims who had attended a mass religious congregation in Delhi. Leaders from the ruling Hindu nationalist BJP called the meeting “CoronaTerrorism” and continue to discriminate against them for supposedly causing COVID-19.
