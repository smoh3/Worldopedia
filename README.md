Welcome to Worldopedia! This was my Kode with Klossy final project, that I built from scratch after a Web Development bootcamp in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I also tested the website with children and parents are received overwhelming positive feedback.
In the future I hope to further innovate and complete the website with backend functionality, and hopefully reach even more users around the world!

Here is the link for quick access to the site preview:
