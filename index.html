  <h1 class="purposetitle">Our Mission</h1>
  <p class="purposemsg">In today’s society, especially with the current global pandemic, BLM movement, crisis in Yemen, and more, many people, especially children, are blissfully unaware of the pressing issues happening around the world. Often times, this can lead to unintentional cultural insensitivity and appropriation when they grow older. There are also kids want to develop a wider world view, but don’t know how or where to get started. Worldopedia is a platform where kids can get educated about cultures around the world and learn about the current events surrounding each country, as well as their widen perspective and promote appreciation for diversity.
