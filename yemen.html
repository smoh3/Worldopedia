          <h2 class="culture">Culture</h2>
          <p class="culture-text">Yemen’s location has highly influenced the cuisine. Beef is often the most expensive meat, so they often eat fish, lamb, goat, and chicken. They also have lots of vegetarian options. Their most popular sport is football (American soccer) and due to their mountains, there’s also a lot of hiking, mountain biking, etc.. Women often wear veils or hijabs and are highly conservative. The dominant religion in Yemen is Muslim. Education is free for primary and secondary school, but the literacy rate still remains low. Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrfice, is an important feast in the Muslim calendar. This feast starts out with a pilgrimage and then they feast on a cow or ram.

          <h2 class="issues">Issues</h2>
            <p class="issues-text">Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, with more than 24 million people – some 80 per cent of the population – in need of humanitarian assistance, including more than 12 million children. It is currently dealing with the coronavirus, famine, war, and a cholera outbreak. Not only are local news stations not reporting about this, no one is helping. Rebels have taken over the capital and are not open to any visitors. People here are facing the worst famine in over a hundred years and all they have to eat are leaves. Children are dying of malnutrition at rapid rates and the ongoing civil war is only making the situation worse. They are also dealing with a cholera outbreak as well as the coronavirus. The culmination of all these events has lead to Yemen's high poverty rate, and it was already one of the Arab world's poorest countries.
