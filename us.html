          <p class="culture-text">The United States is a country made up of immigrants. It’s made up with all races and cultures of people. The United States prides itself on having a democracy and having everyone have rights. Some of those rights include freedom of speech, freedom to assemble, freedom of religion, and freedom to happiness. Hip-hop is one of the most popular styles of dance in the United States and was created in New York City. Some holidays that are special to United States include July 4th, also known as Independence Day, which always includes a huge display of fireworks and some barbeque and Thanksgiving which happens on the fourth Thursday November. Thanksgiving celebrates what we’re thankful for and started in 1621 after the pilgrims first harvest.

            <p class="issues-text">Today, people in the United States are fighting for equality among races, especially black lives. This is not a new issue in the United States, as the injustice started with the start of this nation, however the movement is has recently come into the national spotlight due to public outcry over the deaths of people like George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Amhaud Arbery, to name a few. Black people were orginally brought to this country as slaves against their will. It was not until 1863 that they were legally considered American citizens, and it took even longer for them to be able to vote and have the same rights as white men. People of color in the United States are still struggling with systematic racism and police brutality, and this movement should serve as a call to action for change.
